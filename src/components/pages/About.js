            <h1>My Name is Yorlan Ramirez</h1>

            <p>
              I'm currently a student at Rutger's Coding BootCamp for Full-Stack
              Web Development, excited to begin my adventure as a Software Developer.
            </p>

            <p>I'm a very passionate individual when it comes to Technology.</p>

            <p>
              Working in the Automotive Industry as a Technician has prepared me
              to function well in very stressful environments and also helped me
              acquire strong critical thinking and problem solving skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Adaptivity and quick learning are my strongest features in any
              type of environment.
